# /health is a Unix socket inside the container (mcl_om's health_socket), not a
# port, so this asks the running container itself. Pass the container's name if
# it is not mcl-tube; MCL_ENGINE picks podman over docker:
#
#   scripts/health.sh
#   MCL_ENGINE=podman scripts/health.sh my-mcl-tube
#
# THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO, because they need different responses from whoever is
# reading. Unreachable means the container is not running or not answering.
# Unhealthy means the node is up and telling you something is wrong with it, and
# mcl_om answers that with a 503 carrying a reason. Collapsing the two sends
# you to look in the wrong place.
#
#   0  healthy
#   1  reachable, reports degraded or down
#   2  unreachable
