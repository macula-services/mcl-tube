# THE STORE LIVES UNDER MCL_DATA_DIR (the reckon-db store mcl_tube_store), and
# deploy/docker-compose.yml mounts a host directory there. The read model is
# in memory and rebuilt from the store on boot.

# ⚠ THE TEAM IMAGE PAIR, PINNED BY DATED TAG AND DIGEST. macula-ci-otp is
# macula-io/macula-ci-images' build image: OTP 28.4.3 on Debian trixie with an
# OpenSSL carrying ML-DSA, rebar3 3.27.0 and Rust, all pinned. The release runs
# on macula-pq-runtime of the same date, the same Debian, so its ERTS and NIFs
# match the runtime's glibc. 20260923-1444 is the pair the rocksdb images are
# derived from, so every mcl service sits on one base. lint.yml pins the same
# build image, and the service tests guard all three pins.
