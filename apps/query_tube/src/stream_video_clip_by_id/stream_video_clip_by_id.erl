%% @doc Streaming provider: tube.watch_video_clip. Streams a published
%% clip's bytes off local disk, chunk by chunk -- the mesh Content
%% primitive is never the video-bytes path (spec sec 3, "streamed, not
%% downloaded"). Refuses an unpublished/nonexistent clip via
%% handle_open/2's ordinary {stop, Reason, State} contract -- no
%% workaround needed; macula-io/macula's own bug on that path (StreamPid
%% never aborted, peer stranded until its own recv timeout) is fixed at
%% the source, see macula's CHANGELOG.
