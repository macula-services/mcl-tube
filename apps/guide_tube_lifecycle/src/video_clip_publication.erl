%% @doc Puts or pulls a clip's listing on the mesh catalog rendezvous
%% topics -- shared between the three PM triggers
%% (`on_video_clip_published_publish_clip',
%% `on_video_clip_retracted_withdraw_clip',
%% `on_video_clip_archived_withdraw_clip'), the same way
%% `channel_announcement' is shared between its write-reactive emitter
%% and its heartbeat. Two verbs, not one: `publish_to_mesh/1' makes the
%% clip visible, `withdraw_from_mesh/1' pulls it -- `archived' calls
%% the withdraw path too, since it's a mcl-tube-local terminal state
%% (permanent removal from every local query, "delete" being taboo)
%% and the mesh has no use for the distinction between "temporarily
%% unpublished" and "gone for good", both mean the same thing to a
%% catalog consumer. See plans/EVENT_STORM_HECATE_TUBE.md sec 16.2.
